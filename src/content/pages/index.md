I am a software engineer with an interest in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.

I recently graduated from the [University of Sussex](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/) with a Bachelor's degree in 
[Computer Science](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/computer-science-with-an-industrial-placement-year-bsc).

I hail from [Bandung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandung), Indonesia and currently live in 
[Brighton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton), UK.

I always embrace rapid changes of technology and always eager to learn something new.
