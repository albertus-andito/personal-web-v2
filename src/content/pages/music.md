Music is a big part of my life. Other than listening to music, I also sing and play a fair bit of piano keyboard.
I have been a part of a few number of choirs, including the University of Sussex Chamber Choir, as a Tenor.

In my spare time, I like to record covers and post them online, mostly only to my Instagram account.
However, recently I also posted my low-production recordings to Spotify. You can listen to them below. Make sure you follow!
